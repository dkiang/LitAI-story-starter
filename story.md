# Story Spine Studio: Learning Narrative Techniques from Klara
You will create an ORIGINAL story using narrative techniques from "Klara and the Sun."
*Important:* You're not retelling Ishiguro's scenes—you're borrowing his methods to tell your own story.

## Getting Started: Create and Publish Your Repo

# Story Spine Steps
## Step 1: Identify Narrative Techniques (10 minutes)

From the Beggar Man scene, identify these THREE techniques Ishiguro uses.

WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW
1. **Unique Perception:** How does Klara see something differently than a human would?
Example: She sees sunlight as "nourishment" being "poured"
Your example here (with page #): 
2. **Pattern Tracking:** What does Klara obsessively count, measure, or monitor?
Example: The angle of shadows, time until sun reaches the man
Your example here (with page #): 
3. **Misunderstanding:** What does Klara observe but interpret incorrectly?
Example: Thinks the Sun literally healed the man
Your example here (with page #):

## Step 2: Build Your Original Story Spine (10 minutes)
Create a completely NEW story using the three techniques you identified.
Your story should NOT involve Klara, shops, AFs, or beggar men.

**Story Spine Requirements**  
* Once upon a time… [Must use YOUR technique #1: unique perception]
* Every day… [Must use YOUR technique #2: pattern tracking]
* Until one day… [Something disrupts the pattern]
* Because of that… [Must involve YOUR technique #3: misunderstanding]
* Until finally…
* Ever since that day…

Example of what we mean by "using techniques, not plot":

Ishiguro's technique: Character attributes healing power to the sun
Your original story: Kindergartener believes the classroom goldfish controls who gets picked for show-and-tell

WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW
**Your Original Story Spine**
Once upon a time…
Every day…
Until one day…
Because of that…
Until finally…
Ever since that day…

## Step 3: The AI Prompt Test (15 minutes)

**Prompt A** - Generic Version (2 min to generate):
Copy/paste this exactly:
"Write a 100-word story opening about an unusual narrator observing daily patterns."

*Output A* (PASTE AI RESPONSE HERE):

**Prompt B** - Text-Informed Version (3 min to generate):
Fill in the blanks with YOUR techniques from Step 1:
"Write a 100-word story opening from the perspective of a [your character] who [your unique perception from Step 1], obsessively tracks [your pattern from Step 1], but doesn't understand [your misunderstanding from Step 1]. Use this observational style: [include a short quote from pages 35-41, under 15 words]."

*Output B* (PASTE AI RESPONSE HERE):

**Comparison (10 min)**:
Highlight THREE specific differences between the outputs (WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW)
1.
2.
3.
Which output could ONLY have been written by someone who read Klara? Why?

## Step 4: Revise and Expand (15 minutes)

Take your better AI output and revise it:

**Add these elements:**
- One more specific technique from pages 35-41 (cite page #):
- Adjust the narrator's voice to reflect their limitations
- Ensure your "every day" pattern is visible in the scene

PASTE YOUR REVISED SCENE BELOW:

## Step 5: Rapid Reflection (5 minutes)

**Quick answers (2-3 sentences each):**
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
- Which technique from Ishiguro most shaped your story?
- What specific difference did you notice between generic vs. text-informed prompting?
- Could someone who skipped the reading create your Story Spine? Why not?

## Final Checklist

Make sure all 5 commits are pushed to github.com using GitHub Desktop! (you need to click Push to Origin)

Your commit history should show:
1. Extracted narrative techniques from pages 35-41
2. Created original story spine using Ishiguro's techniques
3. Compared generic vs. text-informed AI outputs
4. Revised scene with additional Ishiguro techniques
5. Completed reflection

## Remember

You're learning to write WITH AI, not having AI write FOR you.

The quality of your textual analysis determines the quality of your creative output.

That's the lesson Ishiguro can teach us about both reading and writing in the age of AI.
